## Episode 9

This time we finish our exploration of classes by looking at additional special methods you can't do without in real-world programs.
Also we will look at the `malloc`/`free` counterparts in c++, aptly named `new` and `delete`, to use create and destroy objects on the heap.

## Episode 8

Let's convert RPSItem structs into classes, and learn about access permissions in the process.

## Episode 7

Today we will improve on our C++ classes and leverage polymorphism based on a class hierarchy, or taxonomy of classes.

## Episode 6

In this episode we will make a huge leap into the world of C++, and translate the program accordingly. In the process we will learn a few bits about C++ classes for sure.

## Episode 5

Once we spoke a little more about heap and stack allocation, we will do a quick run of `valgrind` to check for memory leaks. And since valgrind is a profiler too, we should give that a whirl as well.
If there is time left, we shall have a look at means to emulate object-oriented polymorphism in C.

## Episode 4

Now that we have a 'game-engine' in a separate compile unit, we will start to generalize it even more and start using structures to describe our game state. We will do all this in the name of science, as we need a reason to learn about c structs, as well as the heap at some point :) !

## Episode 3

Now that we know pointers, it's about time to understand how `char*` strings work in C. And as the program will grow a little more complex, we will think about ways to split up our code into multiple files and what that means for the compiler and linker.

## Episode 2

In the second episode we learn what pointers are, and how to use them correctly. This will be a major achievement for everyone set out to learn C or C++.

## Episode 1

We will setup a single-module C program roughly based on [this implementation](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors#C). Qt Creator will be the IDE to help us build and debug this program. We will learn a lot about pointers in the process, it will be fun.
